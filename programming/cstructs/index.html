    <h1>Structures in C</h1>
    <div class="article">
        <p>
            A struct in C is a composite data type. This means that it acts as a containter and gropups variables under
            one name in a block of memory. Some languages call it "record", like Erlang. Structs aren't objects, they
            are different, their fields are public and they can't have methods.
        </p>

        <h2>Declaration</h2>
        <p>
            Use following syntax for declaring structs:
        </p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct name {
    type member1;
    type member2;
    /* you can declare as many as you want, but the size should be know to compiler */
};</code></pre>

        <h2>Using</h2>
        <p>
