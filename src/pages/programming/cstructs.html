            A structure is a composite data type, a collection of variables, that
            can be of different types. These variables are grouped under one name.
            It helps, especially in large programs, to separate and organize data
            units. Some programming languages (Haskell, Erlang, Pascal, etc) call
            it as record. If you came here from OOP langs you can think about
            structures as of classes without methods.

            There is one traditional example of structure: a person is desribed
            by attributes such as name, age, gender, address, phone number, etc.
            Also this struct Person can have nested structs in it, address or
            name may have several components.

            In c struct is declared in this way:
{% highlight c %}
struct Person {
    char *name;
    short age;
    enum Gender gender;
    struct Address adress;
    long phone; // yeah, it is dumb to store phone as number, but whatever
};
{% endhighlight %}
            Right parenthesis could be followed by a list of variables, also
            structs tag, e.g. written after struct keyword, could be ommited,
            but is better not to.<br>
            The thing is,
{% highlight c %}
struct { ... } var1, var2, ...;
{% endhighlight %}
            is the same way of declaring variables as in
{% highlight c %}
int var1, var2, ...;
{% endhighlight %}
        </p>
    </section>

</div>
